### About this repository
This repository is dedicated to exploring the C programming language through practice and project development. 
I believe that the best way to master any technology, including programming languages, is by diving in and getting 
hands-on experience. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to email me at: sudarshanmhasrup@gmail.com.
